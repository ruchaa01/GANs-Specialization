# GANs-Specialization

Course 1: Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)


Week 1 - Intro to GANs
  Build and train a GAN that can generate hand-written images of digits (0-9) using MNIST dataset
  
  
Week 2 - Deep onvolutional GANs
   Implemented a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using MNIST dataset
   
   
Week 3 - Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty
  
  
Week 4 - Conditional GAN & Controllable Generation
